--- 1. Installation ---

    Open a command line of your choice e.g. Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on MacOS and Linux.
    To compile the program for the first time, first navigate to the folder containing the source files (files ending in
    .java). Next, depending on whether you would like to use the client or server program, type either/both:
    - $ javac ChatClient.java
    - $ javac ChatServer.java


--- 2. Running ---

    Once installed, navigate to where the compiled files are located (by default this will be in the same location as
    where you compiled them). Depending on whether you would like to use the client or server program, type either:
    - $ java ChatClient
    - $ java ChatServer

    You may also append the "-gui" flag to the end of either of the above commands in order to run the program with its
    graphical user interface. Furthermore, the following flags may also be used:
    ChatClient:
        - "-ccp" followed by an integer in the range 0 to 65535 to specify the port on the server you would like to
            connect to. By default the client will connect on port 14001.
        - "-cca" followed by a valid IP address or URL to specify the IP address of the server you would like to connect
            to. By default the client will connect to "localhost".

    ChatServer:
        - "-csp" followed by an integer in the range 0 to 65535 to specify the port that the server should bind to. By
            default, the server will bind to port 14001.

    If any of the above flags are combined with the "-gui" flag, you will have the option to override these parameters
    when the GUI launch menu appears.


--- 3. Using the client ---

    --- 3.1 Using the client from the command line ---

    Upon running the program from the command line, you will be prompted to choose a nickname. This name will be
    displayed next to any messages you send. Once you have chosen your name, the client will attempt to connect to the
    server and will inform you if the connection was successful.
    Following this, you may type a message in the command line. Messages cannot contain curly braces ('{' or '}').
    Once you are ready, press the 'enter' key on the keyboard to send it.

    At any time, you may type "EXIT" and press enter to disconnect from the server and close the program.


    --- 3.2 Using the client GUI ---

    Upon running the GUI from the command line, you will be prompted with a menu screen. On this screen you can choose
    the port and hostname/IP address to bind to, as well as the nickname you would like to appear next to all outgoing
    messages. Once you click 'connect', the client will attempt to connect to the server and will inform you as to whether
    the connection was successful.
    Once you are connected, you may type a message in the text field at the bottom of the window. Press the 'enter' key
    on your keyboard or click the 'send' button to send the message. At any time, you may click the exit button at the
    top corner of the window to disconnect from the server and exit the application.


--- 4. Using the server ---

    --- 4.1 Using the server from the command line ---

    Upon running the program from the command line, the server will immediately attempt to bind on the port you have
    specified using the "-csp" flag (or 14001 if no port has been specified). The console output will inform you as to
    whether this was successful or not.
    Once the server is running, clients may connect using the correct port and IP address. Once a client has connected,
    the console will inform you of the port the client connected on, and the local port that they were assigned to. Any
    messages that are sent by clients will appear in the server console.

    At any time, you may type "EXIT" and press enter to shut the server down, disconnecting all clients.


    --- 4.2 Using the server GUI ---

    Upon running the GUI from the command line, you will be prompted with a menu screen. On this screen you can choose
    the port that the server should bind to. Once you click 'launch', the server will attempt to bind to the port you
    have specified and inform you as to whether or not the process was successful.
    When the server is running, you can see the port that the server is open on, as well as the external IP address of
    the system that the server is running on. The latter feature does not work on linux.bath in my testing, due to the
    nature of how the program determines the IP address, however, I have tested it on MacOS.
    By default, the 'messages' pane is in view. This allows you to see all of the messages that the server has handled.
    You can switch to the 'clients' pane (and back) using the tabs at the top. The clients pane displays a list of all
    of the clients that are currently connected.
